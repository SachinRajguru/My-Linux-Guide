# Linux Distributions

Linux distributions (distros) are different versions of Linux that package the Linux kernel with various software, system utilities, and package managers. Each distro is designed for different use cases, such as personal computing, server management, or security. All are free and open-source, with varying levels of stability and customization.

### Pros/Cons Overview
| Distro | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Ubuntu | Beginner-friendly, large community | Slower updates, bloat in some editions |
| Debian | Highly stable, secure | Older packages, less cutting-edge |
| Fedora | Latest features, strong developer focus | Rapid changes can break things |
| Arch Linux | Customizable, lightweight | Steep learning curve, manual setup |
| Kali Linux | Pre-loaded security tools | Not for general use; heavy on resources |
| Alpine Linux | Minimal footprint, secure | Limited software ecosystem |

### Choosing a Distro
- **Consider your needs**: For beginners, start with Ubuntu or Manjaro; for servers, Debian or AlmaLinux; for customization, Arch.
- **Try before installing**: Most distros can be tested via live USB (use tools like Rufus or Etcher). Check hardware compatibility on forums.
- **Flowchart Tip**: Desktop user? → Ubuntu. Server admin? → Debian. Developer? → Fedora. Power user? → Arch.
